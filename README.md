# ðŸš€ Custom Data Structures in C++

This repository contains a set of custom C++ libraries implementing various fundamental data structures and algorithms. These libraries were developed as part of the **Programming and Algorithmization** course to gain deeper understanding of algorithms and their practical implementation in C++.

## ðŸ“š Libraries Included

1. **Deque (dequeue)**
   - A double-ended queue allowing insertion and deletion of elements from both ends.
   - Efficient for applications where both front and back access are needed.

2. **Stack using Array (stackarr)**
   - A stack implemented using a fixed-size array.
   - Supports common stack operations such as `push()`, `pop()` and others.

3. **Stack using Linked List (stacklst)**
   - A dynamic stack implementation using linked lists.
   - Eliminates the need for a fixed size, allowing flexible memory usage.

4. **Complex Number (complex)**
   - A library for handling complex numbers with real and imaginary components.
   - Provides operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of complex numbers.

5. **Rational Number (rational)**
   - A library for working with rational numbers (fractions) represented as two integers (numerator/denominator).
   - Supports arithmetic operations and simplification of fractions.

6. **Binary Search Tree (binarytree)**
   - A binary search tree (BST) implementation allowing for efficient searching, insertion, and deletion of elements.
   - Supports common BST operations like in-order traversal, find, insert, and delete.

7. **Hash Table (hashtable)**
   - A hash table implementation with collision handling using chaining or open addressing.
   - Supports efficient insertion, deletion, and lookup of key-value pairs.
